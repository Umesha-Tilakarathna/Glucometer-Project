# Glucometer Project
 
The project is a glucometer, that displays the glucose level of the body through
invasive means. When a glucose strip is inserted and a blood drop is placed, the
glucometer processes the reading to display the glucose level in mg/dL. The proportional
current signal generated in the strip is amplified, converted to voltage and processed
using the microcontroller and displayed finally.

The repository contains the Schematic Designs, Altium Designs, Solidwork Designs, 
and the code that was used to process the analog signal.
